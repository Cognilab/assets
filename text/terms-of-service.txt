SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) AGREEMENT\
\'a0\
IMPORTANT-READ THIS SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE AGREEMENT (THIS \'93AGREEMENT\'94) CAREFULLY BEFORE CONTINUING TO SIGN UP. BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON OR OTHERWISE ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, USERS AGREE TO FOLLOW AND BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF USERS ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND, IF THE USER DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF THE USER DOES NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE USER MUST SELECT THE "I DECLINE" BUTTON AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.\
\'a0\
This software-as-a-service agreement (the \'93Agreement\'94) is an agreement between the individual or entity that has signed up for a trial or account and ordered services (the \'93User\'94) and Cognilab Technologies Incorporated (\'93Cognilab\'94). Cognilab provides Users with access to use the Cognilab experiment builder platform (the \'93Platform\'94) and certain Materials (as defined below) to help Users create, design, conduct and analyze social science research experiments by providing general and personalized content, templates, communication tools and forums and services (collectively, the \'93Services\'94) directly and through the website and associated domains of www.cognilab.com (the \'93Site\'94).\'a0\
\'a0\
A. Rights Granted and Provision of Services\
Subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement, the User has the nonexclusive, non-assignable, royalty free, worldwide limited right to use the Services solely to create, design, conduct and analyze social science research experiments for User\'92s internal research and business operations through a user identification reference provided by Cognilab (\'93User ID\'94). Users may allow their experiment participants (the \'93Participants\'94) to use the Services for this purpose but Users are responsible for their Participants\'92 compliance with this Agreement.\
\'a0\
Cognilab will provide Users one User ID for each account held by Users, thereby permitting Users access to the Materials on one computer at a time through the Site. \'a0Users agree to fully and accurately provide the information requested by Cognilab when setting up User accounts and to regularly update such information. \'a0A User\'92s failure to do so may result in the cancellation of the User account and loss of Services. Users further agree (a) not to provide User IDs to anyone who is not their employee, and (b) to ensure all individuals permitted to use the User IDs are aware of and have agreed in writing to comply with the terms of this Agreement.\'a0\
\'a0\
B. Term\
The term (\'93Term\'94) of this Agreement will start when a User signs up to become a user and will continue until it expires in accordance with the plan type subscribed for by the User or until this Agreement terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\'a0\
\'a0\
C. Payments\'a0\
All applications, features, functionality and support provided by Cognilab are provided for the fees described for each plan type and Service on the Site (\'93Fees\'94) and Users are liable for such Fees. All Fees are non-cancelable and the sums paid non-refundable. Fees listed on the Site are exclusive of sales taxes. Only Services and features clearly indicated as "free" or "no charge" are free or without charge. It is not the responsibility of Cognilab to provide free support for Users in the use and operation of the Platform.\
\'a0\
Users agree that they have not relied on the future availability of any Services, programs or updates in entering into the payment obligations described on the Site; however, the preceding does not relieve Cognilab of its obligation to deliver Services that Users have paid for in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\
\'a0\
Users can opt to upgrade or downgrade their service agreement to any other contract agreement that Cognilab offers for sale at any time during the Term.\
\'a0\
At the end of the Term, User contracts will automatically renew for an additional Term until explicitly cancelled by Users.\
\'a0\
If a User registered for a trial use of the Services ("Trial Period"), the User must decide to purchase the Services within the Trial Period in order to retain any Content that Users have posted or uploaded during the Trial Period. If Users do not purchase the Services by the end of the Trial Period, User Content will no longer be available to Users. To be very clear, after using the Services during the Trial Period, if Users decide not to purchase the full version of the Services, Users will not be able to access or retrieve any of the data Users added/created during the Trial Period.\'a0\
\'a0\
If Users purchase any Services that Cognilab offers for a Fee, Users agree to Cognilab, or our third party service providers, storing User payment card information. \'a0Users expressly agree that Cognilab is authorized to charge Users (i) a monthly Fee for any applicable Services billed on a monthly basis, (ii) any other Fees for Services Users may purchase, and (iii) any applicable taxes in connection with User use of the Services to the payment card Users provide and to reimburse Cognilab for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. \'a0If the payment card Users provide expires and Users do not provide new payment card information or cancel User account, Users authorize Cognilab to continue billing Users and Users agree to remain responsible for any uncollected Fees.\
\'a0\
